# Hate Speech Detection  

## Overview  
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect hate speech in text data. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, the model identifies harmful or offensive content. The goal is to help in moderating online platforms and prevent the spread of toxic content.  

## Features  
- Preprocessing of text data by removing noise, stopwords, and special characters.  
- Feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF and word embeddings.  
- Implementation of classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Deep Learning models (if applicable).  
- Evaluation of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries/Tools**:  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data handling.  
  - `sklearn` for machine learning models and metrics.  
  - `nltk` or `spacy` for text preprocessing.  
  - `tensorflow` or `keras` for deep learning (if applicable).  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
